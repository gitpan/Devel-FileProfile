NAME
     Devel::FileProfiler - quick & easy per-file statistical profiler

SYNOPSIS
     use Devel::FileProfile;

DESCRIPTION
    Devel::FileProfile is a very simple statistical profiler. Unlike
    Devel::Profile, it will not slow down the execution of your program and
    it will not take forever to generate the profile results.

    On the other hand, the profile results are not nearly as detailed.

    To use it, just "use Devel::FileProfile" in any file you want profiled.
    When your program is done executing, it will dump a partial code-listing
    to STDERR with the percentage of time spent on each line annotated. It
    does statistical sampling so most lines won't be listed.

    The output format is:

     %%% line# code

    For each line listed, several lines of the surrounding code are shown to
    provide context.

    There are many improvements that could be made to this module. Feel free
    to make them and send a patch to the author. The module meets the
    author's needs as is. The code is very very simple.

BUGS
    Devel::FileProfile uses $SIG{ALRM}. It is not currently compatabile with
    any other uses of $SIG{ALRM}. It potentially could know about things
    like Event and use them but it does not currently do that.
